# Notice
This is a really old project early in my time learning C++, I do not recommend looking at this project as a source of reference for an actual game engine, as there are *many* flaws in the code. You have been warned.

This project will continue to be kept for archival reasons.

# CPPThunderEngine
Remake of the original that was made in Java. This engine uses SDL2 for all rendering and graphics.

## TODO
- [X] Change the class name to a general file (basically merge the classes.
- [X] Stop using classes (note: I don't mean stop using classes period, I mean stop using it when they don't need to be used).
- [X] Use struct's more in this engine.
